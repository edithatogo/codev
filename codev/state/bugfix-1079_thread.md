# Bugfix 1079 thread

## Investigate
Started BUGFIX investigation in strict mode. Issue reports `agy --print` is followed by another option, causing Antigravity CLI 1.0.10 to consume that option as the prompt.

Reproduced with installed `agy` 1.0.10:

- `agy --print --sandbox --print-timeout 45s 'Reply with exactly: AGY_ORDER_OK'` returned generic readiness text instead of the marker.
- `agy --sandbox --print-timeout 45s --print 'Reply with exactly: AGY_ORDER_OK'` returned exactly `AGY_ORDER_OK`.
- The installed `consult -m gemini --prompt 'Reply with exactly: CONSULT_GEMINI_OK'` returned empty-sandbox guidance, confirming the user-facing path is affected.

Root cause confirmed at `packages/codev/src/commands/consult/index.ts`: argv begins `--print --sandbox`, so agy consumes `--sandbox` as the string value of `--print`; the folded role/query is left as a trailing positional. `packages/codev/src/commands/doctor.ts` repeats the same contract violation with `--print --print-timeout ...`. Existing unit assertions check token presence or assume the prompt is simply the final token, so they do not enforce adjacency. A guarded real-agy integration test exists but currently exercises a file-reading task rather than explicitly locking the 1.0.10 print-value contract.

Scope assessment: minimal argv reordering plus focused unit/integration assertions across the two call sites; well under 300 LOC and no architecture change. BUGFIX remains appropriate.

## Fix

Reordered both call sites so all agy options precede the final `--print <prompt>` pair. Regression tests now assert adjacency for direct prompts, the `pro` alias, prompt files, folded role/query text, large-prompt indirection, and the doctor probe (including its `20s` timeout). Added a guarded real-agy contract test.

Verification:

- New unit assertions failed against the old ordering (`--sandbox` / `--print-timeout` observed as the print value), then passed after the fix.
- `pnpm build` passed.
- `pnpm test -- --run` passed: 166 files passed, 3 skipped; 3339 tests passed, 48 skipped.
- Guarded real-agy 1.0.10 inline contract test passed and returned its unique marker.
- Guarded real-agy file-access test passed and returned the planted file marker.
- Built front doors returned exact markers for `-m gemini --prompt`, `-m pro --prompt`, and `-m gemini --prompt-file`.
