  TEMPLATE — copy to docs/releases/UNRELEASED.md at the start of each release cycle:

  Edit UNRELEASED.md across the cycle (the working copy). NEVER edit this

  Per-PR architect workflow (on the docs/vscode-changelog branch):
    1. cd worktrees/changelog                       # no fetch / no rebase — branches diverge by design
    2. Add the CHANGELOG entry to packages/vscode/CHANGELOG.md under [Unreleased]
       (add the [Unreleased] heading if it's missing — post-release state removes it)
    3. Add the matching release-notes entry to UNRELEASED.md under the right section:
         substantive change → its own ## section
         small vscode item  → Polish
         non-vscode change  → Other fixes

  Why no rebase, ever: main moves with code merges, docs/vscode-changelog moves

  Rebasing rewrites commit hashes and forces force-pushes for zero real benefit.

  At release time:
    1. Rename the title to `# vX.Y.Z <Codename>` and add `Released: YYYY-MM-DD`

## Gemini consult lane swaps to Antigravity CLI (`agy`) before Gemini-CLI retires (#778, PR #988)

Google retires the Gemini CLI subscription serving (Pro / Ultra / free) on **2026-06-18**. After that date the old binary that Codev's `gemini` consult lane shells out to will stop returning valid responses. This release swaps the lane's backend to the **Antigravity CLI (`agy`)** so consults keep working past the deadline.

This is a backend swap, not a redesign. The user-facing surface is unchanged: the model identifier stays `gemini`, the `pro` alias is retained, `consult -m gemini` works the same way, porch's `consultation` lane continues to address gemini by name. Only the binary that the lane shells out to changed.

A few design calls worth noting:

- **OAuth-only backend.** `agy` cannot take an API key (verified), so there is no separate Gemini Developer API backend. Users authenticate via `agy auth` (OAuth subscription) — same Google account that powers Antigravity.
- **agy's default model, no version pin.** Stays on whatever model `agy` defaults to. Codev doesn't pin a specific Gemini version anymore (the old Gemini CLI accepted explicit `--model gemini-2.5-pro` etc).
- **Non-blocking skip when agy isn't ready.** Missing binary, unauthenticated, IDE-symlink stub, or per-call timeout all produce a `VERDICT: COMMENT`. Porch's `allApprove` treats this as non-blocking, so phases still advance with a 2-way consult (Claude + Codex). This is the failure mode the swap defends against — your consults keep working with a degraded panel rather than blocking.
- **Real-binary preference.** `resolveAgyBin()` rejects the Antigravity IDE's `agy` symlink (by realpath) and prefers the real headless CLI. `CODEV_AGY_BIN` env var overrides if needed.

**Operationally important if you use the `gemini` consult lane**: install `agy` and run `agy auth` before 2026-06-18 to keep your gemini consults blocking-equivalent to today. After that date, without agy, the lane skips with `COMMENT` and your consults run 2-way (Claude + Codex) instead of 3-way. The skip is non-blocking but you lose Gemini's review opinion.

`codev doctor` now checks for `agy` presence and authentication state; install guidance is surfaced in its output.

**Note on the builder harness.** The Gemini-CLI **builder** harness (`harness.ts` plus README CLI flag and config examples) stays on the retired CLI per the approved spec scope. That migration is tracked as a follow-up — different surface from consult, different timing pressure.

## Tower version preflight: warn when running Tower is behind installed CLI (#983, PR #1000)

The v3.1.7 #791 CLI preflight verified that the installed `codev` CLI was at least as new as the VS Code extension. That check inspects the binary on disk. It does not, and could not, tell whether the running Tower process is executing that same code. After an `npm install -g @cluesmith/codev` upgrade without a Tower restart, the two diverge silently: the installed binary is the new version, the running Tower is still serving stale handlers from whatever code was loaded when it last started. The user hits 404s on new routes, stale wire shapes, and bug fixes that don't seem to apply, with no signal anywhere that an upgrade hasn't fully taken effect.

This release closes that gap with three coordinated pieces:

1. **Tower exposes its in-memory version.** A new read-only `GET /api/version` endpoint returns the version of the currently running Tower process plus the boot timestamp. The value is whatever code Tower actually loaded, not the disk binary.

2. **The VS Code extension probes it alongside the existing CLI preflight.** On every successful connection to Tower, the extension fetches `/api/version` and compares the running Tower's version against the installed CLI's version. When the running Tower is behind, a divergence toast surfaces with a `Restart Tower` action. One click runs `afx tower stop && afx tower start`, polls `/health` until Tower comes back up, and re-probes to confirm the restart loaded the newer code.

3. **The healthy path stays silent.** When running matches installed, no toast appears. The CLI-row tooltip in the Status view surfaces both versions side by side, so the up-to-date state is visible at a glance without being noisy.

Two design calls worth a conscious nod:

- **The divergence rule is `running < installedCLI`, not `running < extension`.** Comparing against the extension version would produce a futile restart prompt naming a version that isn't installed (a restart can't load code that isn't on disk). The "CLI is behind the extension" condition stays as #791's existing concern, with its existing "update CLI via npm" toast.
- **The 404 path (Tower too old to even report its version) is gated on the installed CLI itself being current.** When the installed CLI is itself the source of the running Tower's old code (the extension updated ahead of the CLI), restarting Tower would just reload the same code that still lacks the endpoint. In that scenario the prompt is suppressed and #791's "update CLI" toast handles the recovery instead. The remedy fires only when the remedy actually fixes the condition.

The in-extension restart action depends on the just-shipped #991 Tower fix: before that fix, the unfiltered `lsof` in `afx tower stop` would have killed the extension host's own sockets when the extension self-triggered a restart. With #991's `-sTCP:LISTEN` scoping, the stop targets only Tower's listener, so the extension self-restarting Tower is now safe.

## Terminals survive Tower restarts (#991, PR #999)

`afx tower stop && afx tower start` used to be disruptive in two distinct, compounding ways. Open builder and architect terminals would drop their connections; the VSCode extension host itself would restart; recovery code that was supposed to reconnect the terminals never got a chance to run because the very process running it was being killed. This release fixes both layers at the source. After a restart, open terminals reconnect to the same session within the normal backoff window, replaying any buffered output, with no dead pane, no manual reopen, and no new window.

### What was actually going on

Two Tower-level bugs compounded:

1. **`afx tower stop` was killing more than Tower.** `getProcessesOnPort` used `lsof -ti :PORT` to find what to terminate. That selector returns both the **listener** (the Tower server) AND every **client** holding a socket to the port. The VSCode extension host holds client sockets (one for SSE, one per terminal WebSocket), so `afx tower stop` SIGTERM'd the entire VSCode extension host on every restart. Every "click here to reconnect" affordance, every backoff retry, every state-refresh loop that earlier issues shipped was being silently destroyed by the very command that should have left them alone. Fixed by restricting the selector to listening sockets: `lsof -ti :PORT -sTCP:LISTEN`.

2. **Terminal ids were not preserved across restart.** When Tower came back up and reconciled persistent shellper-backed sessions, it minted a fresh `randomUUID()` for each one. The client's `/ws/terminal/<old-id>` URL went dead, even though the underlying session was alive on the other side of a new id. Fixed by threading the persisted `dbSession.id` through `createSessionRaw` and both reconcile paths, so a session keeps its identity across a restart.

With both fixes in place, the existing transport-reconnect layer (`@cluesmith/codev-core/reconnect-policy`, the terminal adapters from #936 and #971) handles a Tower restart as an ordinary transient drop. No special recovery code path is needed because the URL the client was already using stays valid.

### Why the cycle's earlier terminal work landed where it did

#936 (VSCode terminal reconnect bounding and give-up), #971 (web terminal session-unknown fast-path), and even this issue's original client-side framing were all responses to a symptom whose root cause was upstream. Preserving the terminal id removes the dead-id condition those layers were defensively guarding against. The client-side affordances all remain in place as harmless safety nets, but the common case (a routine Tower restart on `pnpm -w run local-install` or similar) now self-recovers without ever exercising them.

A small edge case remains: a client reconnect that lands after Tower accepts connections but before startup reconcile re-registers the session could 404 once and recover on the next retry or click. Rare in practice; the deterministic follow-up is tracked separately as #997 (reconcile before serving requests).

### Two durable lessons recorded with this release

Worth carrying forward to anyone building recovery layers on top of distributed components:

- **Confirm the runtime survives the event before building recovery on top of it.** Many iterations of client-side terminal recovery had to be reverted before checking the single most important precondition (does the extension host even survive `afx tower stop`?). It did not. A one-line check at `lsof -ti :PORT` would have redirected the entire effort on day one.
- **Fix the source, not the symptom.** Multiple cycles of work across this codebase were tracking consequences of the terminal id changing on restart. The cheapest fix is often well upstream of where the symptom shows.

## Tower readiness barrier: terminal reads no longer race startup reconcile (#997, PR #1004)

#991 closed the dominant Tower-restart bugs but explicitly deferred one rare edge case: a client reconnect that landed after Tower accepted connections but before `reconcileTerminalSessions()` had re-registered persistent (shellper-backed) sessions could 404 once and recover on the next retry or click. This release closes that window.

Tower now uses a startup-readiness barrier as an internal ordering signal. The HTTP listener still binds immediately (preserving liveness, so any supervisor's wait-for-port check is unchanged), but the readers of reconcile's output (`getRehydratedTerminalsEntry`, the `/ws/terminal/:id` upgrade routes) await the barrier before responding. The first reachable `/api/state` and `/api/overview` after restart now sees a complete `role → terminalId` mapping with no client-side polling.

The `/health` endpoint adds an optional `ready: boolean` field exposing the same signal explicitly, so an external supervisor that wants readiness (not just liveness) can check it without inferring. `status: 'healthy'` stays pure liveness, which matters for `restartTower`'s existing wait-for-`/health` logic.

Three independent barrier-release paths ensure serving can never wedge: `reconcileTerminalSessions()`'s `finally` block (success or throw), its early-return path when `shellperManager` is absent, and a defensive timeout (`CODEV_STARTUP_READY_TIMEOUT_MS`, default 10s). On the defensive timeout the individual request proceeds; the barrier itself stays unsettled until reconcile genuinely finishes, so `/health.ready` doesn't lie.

One durable lesson recorded with this release: process-liveness is not readiness. `server.listen()` firing (and `/health` returning `healthy`) means the process accepts connections, not that async startup work is done. Gate consumers of startup-reconcile output on an explicit completion barrier, and keep the liveness signal separate from the readiness signal so a slow reconcile can't make Tower look dead to a supervisor.

## Web terminal stops on dead sessions almost instantly (#971, PR #992)

When Tower restarts or otherwise loses a session, the dashboard's web terminal used to spend the full 6-attempt backoff (~60s) blindly retrying before giving up, because a browser can't read a failed WebSocket upgrade's HTTP status (it only sees close `1006`). v3.1.7's #961 narrowed the retry budget from 50 to 6 attempts but left the underlying mismatch in place. This release closes the gap: the web terminal now matches VSCode's near-instant give-up behavior.

Tower discriminates browser clients from Node clients via the `Origin` header. Browsers (which always send `Origin`) get an accepted WebSocket upgrade followed immediately by a close with the app-range code `4404`. The core reconnect-policy helper recognises `4404` as a permanent failure, and the dashboard's `onclose` handler fast-paths on it. Node clients (which never send `Origin`) keep the existing HTTP `404` upgrade-rejection path that #936's VSCode fast-path relies on, so there is no regression.

One transient retry is still expected when a session is killed mid-connection: the first drop sees the generic `1006` close (transient → one retry), the reconnect attempt hits `4404` → give up. Matches the VSCode sequence. Total dashboard dead-time for a killed session: roughly one backoff interval (1s), down from ~60s.

A follow-up (#991) tracks the next layer: a stale tab on a pre-restart terminal id can't self-recover because persistent sessions return under a new id after a Tower restart. The give-up signal is now correct; the auto-remount-onto-successor-id affordance is deferred.

## Codev Dev surface: bottom-panel tab + status-bar chip (#921, PR #996)

Two new complementary VSCode surfaces for the single `afx dev` PTY, so a reviewer can see at a glance whether a dev server is running, for which target, and stop or restart it fast without hunting through the terminal dropdown.

The **`Codev: Dev` tab** (the first real view inside #812's bottom-panel container) shows a status header: target name, live-ticking uptime, and best-effort port when derivable from `worktree.devUrls` or `worktree.devCommand`. Title-bar actions for Stop, Restart, Switch Target, and Show / Hide the Codev sidebar. When no dev is running, a placeholder row; when one was running and stopped, a brief "Stopped..." epitaph row.

An **always-visible status-bar chip** (`$(server-process) Dev: <target>`) appears in the bottom bar only while a dev is running, disappearing on stop. Click it to focus the Codev Dev tab. The chip is the at-a-glance signal that survives regardless of which surface you happen to be in.

Both surfaces derive from the single `TerminalManager.onDidChangeDevTerminals` event, so they stay in lockstep automatically. The native `Codev: <name> (dev)` terminal stays as the actual output surface; the new tab and chip coexist with it as status indicators rather than replacing the output. No PTY re-plumbing.

Two implementation details worth a conscious nod, captured as lessons-learned: VSCode's `StatusBarItem.backgroundColor` only honors `errorBackground` / `warningBackground`, not `prominentBackground`, so a "prominent but not alarming" cue uses the foreground (`prominentForeground`) instead. And `$(zap)` now reads as the AI / sparkle glyph in VSCode, so non-AI features want a literal glyph like `$(server-process)`.

## Polish

- **"No active terminal" toast self-heals and surfaces a recovery action** (#982, PR #1006). The `Codev: No active terminal for X` toast used to fire once per session as a dead-end warning, then silently swallow subsequent reattempts even when Tower was already reconnecting. Terminal resolution now runs a short bounded retry before raising any UI, so transient reconnect windows self-heal without ever bothering the user. When the retries genuinely fail, the toast carries two actions: `Retry` (re-runs the resolve attempt) and `Recover Builders` (opens a terminal at the main checkout running `afx workspace recover --dry-run`, so the user reviews the scope before applying — recover is workspace-wide and can touch builders the user didn't mean to revive). The recover terminal's cwd is resolved through a `mainCheckoutRoot()` helper that strips a trailing `/.builders/<id>` from the detected workspace path, so `afx` runs from main even when VSCode is rooted at a worktree window. Adjacent to the #991 / #997 Tower-side restart work that eliminated the dominant causes of post-restart dead sessions; this closes the user-facing loop for the residual cases.
- **Builders no longer briefly flash into `UNCATEGORIZED` during cleanup** (#907, PR #1003). When a builder was cleaned up, the Builders tree used to re-render it under the `UNCATEGORIZED` group for a few seconds before it finally disappeared. The area was re-derived every refresh from the open-issues list, so once the builder's issue was unreachable (closed on PR merge, torn down mid-cleanup, or a failed fetch) the lookup missed and the row fell back to its `Uncategorized` default. With #818's area grouping that fallback turned into a placement jump. A new `ResolvedEnrichmentCache` now memoizes the last resolved value while the issue source remains reachable; the fallback gates on *source reachability*, not value emptiness, so a reachable-but-unlabeled issue still caches a genuine `Uncategorized` and a real label change still propagates. Builders on issues that genuinely have no `area/*` label continue to live under `UNCATEGORIZED` throughout their lifecycle. A bundled-in build-tooling fix made the root `pnpm build` build `@cluesmith/codev-types` before the rest of the workspace, after the unbuilt `types` package crashed the extension at the dev-approval gate (see `codev/resources/lessons-learned.md` for the durable note on source-vs-built `exports` resolution).
- **Terminal reconnect notice overwrites in place and wipes on reconnect** (#1001, PR #1002). The retry notice (`[Codev: Connection lost. retrying in Xs (attempt Y/6)]`) used to print one `\r\n`-terminated line per attempt, stacking notices in scrollback and leaving them orphaned above the resumed output once Tower came back. The #936 reconnect overhaul intended an in-place overwrite but only half-implemented it. This release completes the pattern: each retry leads with `\r\x1b[2K` so the same line ticks the counter, and a `clearReconnectNotice()` call on the `ws.on('open')` success path wipes that single line before Tower replays its buffered output. The give-up state (red `Click here to reconnect`) is preserved as-is: it stays visible as the terminal's failure state and is intentionally not wiped.
- **Guarded commands always give feedback now** (#989, PR #995). Clicking a CLI-dependent command (Spawn Builder, Approve Gate, Send Message, and 12 others) while the Codev CLI is missing or outdated used to produce a modal toast on the first click of the session, then go completely silent on every subsequent click for the rest of the session. The first-click modal is unchanged (the `Run Setup` action still works); subsequent clicks now show a brief auto-dismissing status-bar message naming the state and pointing at `Codev: Recheck CLI` as the recovery path. Once a recheck confirms `ok`, the modal-first pattern restarts the next time the state breaks. Implementation factors the feedback dispatch into a reusable `showPreflightFeedback` helper, so #983's Tower-version-divergence work can surface its own state through the same channel without reinventing the suppression logic.
- **New `Codev` tab in the bottom panel** (#812, PR #990). A second view container joins the existing activitybar Codev sidebar, this time docked alongside Problems / Output / Terminal in the bottom panel area. It opens once on first activation for discoverability, then stays out of the way. Initially shows a single placeholder row signposting the upcoming view migrations (Recently Closed, Team, Status) that will populate the panel in follow-up PRs. The activitybar sidebar is unchanged. Constraint worth noting: VS Code provides no positional control for panel view containers, so a new tab lands last and would otherwise spill into the `…` overflow; the one-time globalState-guarded reveal is the only discoverability lever available.

## Other fixes (dashboard, porch, infrastructure)

- **Builders with a merged PR but a still-pending `pr` gate no longer vanish from the dashboard's Needs Attention** (#966, PR #980). After a merge, a builder whose porch `pr` gate hadn't yet been approved silently dropped off both the Needs Attention rows and the Work surface entirely. Its PR had moved to recently-closed (so didn't surface via the open-PRs path), while its still-pending gate was incorrectly read as "ready". They now correctly surface via the gate-row path, matching the human-attention model where a merged-but-gate-pending builder is exactly what needs acknowledgement.
- **`consult -m claude` now bills against the Claude subscription, not the metered Opus API** (#985, PR #986). When both `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` (subscription auth) and `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (metered API auth) were set in the environment, consult's Claude subprocess silently picked up the API key, routing all CMAP traffic through the metered API. The consult helper now strips the API-key vars from the subprocess's env copy when an OAuth token is present, so traffic routes via the subscription. CI and key-only environments are unaffected (no OAuth token → API key still used). Reported by an external adopter at roughly $150/day on a heavy dev day before the fix.
