 * These let a CONTROLLER (an external control device or companion app) drive and
 * observe the active editor PROVIDER (the VSCode extension today, the web
 * dashboard later) over Tower's existing SSE + REST transport:
 *  - controller -> Tower: REST POST `/api/editor/*` (context demand, presence)
 *    and `/api/command` (run a canonical verb on the active provider).
 *  - provider  -> Tower: REST POST `/api/editor/context`.
 *  - Tower -> clients: SSE `editor-wants-context` / `command` to the provider;
 *    `editor-context` to controllers.
 *
 * The command channel carries CANONICAL VERBS (`view-diff`, `forward-hunk`, ...),
 * not provider-specific command ids, so one controller drives any provider; each
 * provider maps the verb to its own implementation. Pure wire shapes only.
