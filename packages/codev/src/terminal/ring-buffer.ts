/**
 * Maximum bytes retained in the incomplete-line `partial` (Issue #1047).
 * A full-screen TUI (alternate screen buffer) redraws in place with
 * cursor-addressing and carriage returns and emits almost no `\n`, so the
 * `partial` would otherwise grow without bound — turning every `pushData`
 * into an O(n) re-scan (O(n²) over the session) and producing a multi-MB
 * replay payload that overflows the terminal client's backpressure budget.
 * 256 KB is far above any realistic single line yet bounds per-frame work,
 * memory, and the replay payload. Stays well under the VSCode client's 1 MB
 * `MAX_QUEUE` so a replay never trips client backpressure.
