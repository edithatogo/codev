/**
 * Regression test for GitHub Issue #744
 *
 * The SPIR/ASPIR builder-prompt templates did not state the PR-strategy
 * convention explicitly. Builders interpreted "each phase commits
 * independently" as "each phase gets its own PR" and shipped per-phase
 * PRs that the architect then had to close.
 *
 * This test verifies that all four SPIR/ASPIR builder-prompt files contain:
 *   1. An explicit prohibition on the builder autonomously opening a PR
 *      per implementation phase.
 *   2. The clarification that "each phase commits independently" refers
 *      to git commits, not PRs.
 *   3. The architect-override carve-out — the architect may still request
 *      a PR at any point (spec review, mid-impl feedback, slicing, etc.).
